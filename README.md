A fork of [VelocityX State Management](https://pub.dev/packages/vxstate) with some modifications and improvements.

## FAQ

### Why is this package called `layrz_state`?

All packages developed by [Layrz](https://layrz.com) are prefixed with `layrz_`, check out our other packages on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/publishers/goldenm.com/packages).

### Why a fork?

The original package ([vxstate](https://pub.dev/packages/vxstate)) looks unmaintained, and we needed some features that were not available in the original package, so we decided to fork it and maintain our own version.

### Do you have other libraries?

Of course! We have multiple libraries (for Layrz or general purpose) that you can use in your projects, you can find us on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/user/goldenm/) for Python libraries, [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/profiles/goldenm) for Ruby gems, [NPM of Golden M](https://www.npmjs.com/~goldenm) or [NPM of Layrz](https://www.npmjs.com/~layrz-software) for NodeJS libraries or here in [Pub.dev](https://pub.dev/publishers/goldenm.com/packages) for Dart/Flutter libraries.
